## Refine Workflow

Follow CLAUDE.md rules for all changes.

Analyze project for improvements. Add to or update RefineProgress.md.

Improvement scope:
- Project structure
- Features (add, modify, breakdown, regroup)
- Code quality
- Specification clarity

Constraint: Project functionality must be preserved.

Priority: structure (code/project design) > features > code quality > specification clarity

Planning (RefineProgress.md generation):
- No limit on tasks
- Include size estimate and dependencies for each
- No execution during planning
- Planning work is cross-flavor (projectDescription/ is generic)

Scope limitation: Tasks in RefineProgress.md describe planning phase work. Execution follows all applicable phases as defined in CLAUDE.md.

Validation: After modifying RefineProgress.md, verify all tasks comply with CLAUDE.md and rules from this file.

Execution: Only when user asks. Follow CLAUDE.md and execute the task. Verify after change.

Task types: implementation or analysis (may add tasks or modify plan)
